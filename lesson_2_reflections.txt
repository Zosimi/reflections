What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	I create a GIT repository. I need to do this to be able to start making commits and to start tracking them.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temporary area where you group the files you want to be included in the same commit. The working directory on the other hand includes all files in your local repository.
