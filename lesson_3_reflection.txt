When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I'm for example sitting at another computer and don't have access to all my local files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I might work on something different and not be ready to merge my material with the one available on GitHub. Doing it manually gives me control in for example which branch added material will be placed or where a merge will occur.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	FORK
	This is a clone of a repository on GitHub

	CLONE
	This is a local clone of either a local repository or from GitHub.

	BRANCH
	A branch exists within a single repository and is built on previous commits in that repository.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can continue working offline knowing that you are working on the latest version at that time.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	It would be harder to merge files into one. Without GitHub you would have to communicate more with your co-workers to try not working on the same pieces of code. It would be much harder to see what code has been changed or not changed. Without GitHub I would save many versions of my code locally.
